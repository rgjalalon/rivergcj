# The Wellness: app walkthrough video

A 30-second product video (1920×1080, 30fps, H.264 MP4) built with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev).
It shows a walkthrough of The Wellness clinic app: home → booking calendar → treatment detail → confirmation → end card.

**Rendered file:** [`renders/the-wellness-app.mp4`](renders/the-wellness-app.mp4)

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run studio   # live preview in the browser
npm run render   # writes out/the-wellness-app.mp4
```

If Remotion can't download its own headless Chrome, point it at an installed one:
`REMOTION_BROWSER=/path/to/chrome-headless-shell npm run render`.

## Timeline (frames at 30fps)

| Scene | Frames | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Home | 0–126 | Phone fades in on cream; greeting and booking card appear in sequence |
| 2. Booking | 126–336 | Tap "Book a treatment" → calendar pushes in → date tap → time slot highlight → Continue |
| 3. Treatment | 336–522 | Detail screen: image placeholder, description, price → Confirm booking |
| 4. Confirmation | 522–705 | Ring and checkmark draw on, booking summary |
| 5. End card | 705–900 | Espresso background, logo, "Wellness, made personal" |

Key moments live in `src/timeline.ts`. UI transitions are 300ms (9 frames) with an ease-out curve and no overshoot.

## Editing

- **Copy** (name, treatment, price, captions, tagline): `src/copy.ts`
- **Palette and fonts**: `src/theme.ts` (Playfair Display and Inter are bundled in `public/fonts`)
- **Logo**: `src/components/EndCard.tsx` currently shows a placeholder monogram and wordmark. Swap in the real logo asset there.
- **Treatment image**: the placeholder is in `src/screens/DetailScreen.tsx`. Drop an image in `public/` and use `<Img src={staticFile(...)} />`.
- **Film grain and vignette**: `src/components/Grain.tsx`
