# The Wellness: app walkthrough video

A 30-second product video (1920×1080, 30fps, H.264 MP4) built with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev).
It shows a walkthrough of The Wellness clinic app: home → booking calendar → treatment detail → confirmation → end card.

**Rendered file:** [`renders/the-wellness-app.mp4`](renders/the-wellness-app.mp4)

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run studio   # live preview in the browser
npm run render   # writes out/the-wellness-app.mp4
```

If Remotion can't download its own headless Chrome, point it at an installed one:
`REMOTION_BROWSER=/path/to/chrome-headless-shell npm run render`.

## Timeline (frames at 30fps)

| Scene | Frames | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Home | 0–126 | Phone fades in on cream; greeting and booking card appear in sequence |
| 2. Booking | 126–336 | Tap "Book a treatment" → calendar pushes in → date tap → time slot highlight → Continue |
| 3. Treatment | 336–522 | Detail screen: image placeholder, description, price → Confirm booking |
| 4. Confirmation | 522–705 | Ring and checkmark draw on, booking summary |
| 5. End card | 705–900 | Espresso background, logo, "Wellness, made personal" |

Key moments live in `src/timeline.ts`. UI transitions are 300ms (9 frames) with an ease-out curve and no overshoot.

## Editing

- **Copy** (name, treatment, price, captions, tagline): `src/copy.ts`
- **Palette and fonts**: `src/theme.ts` (Playfair Display and Inter are bundled in `public/fonts`)
- **Logo**: `src/components/EndCard.tsx` currently shows a placeholder monogram and wordmark. Swap in the real logo asset there.
- **Treatment image**: the placeholder is in `src/screens/DetailScreen.tsx`. Drop an image in `public/` and use `<Img src={staticFile(...)} />`.
- **Film grain and vignette**: `src/components/Grain.tsx`

# Wai: brand film (vertical)

A 30-second vertical video (1080×1920, 30fps) for Wai. It follows the structure and pacing of the reference edit: quick real-life cuts, then an app screen, more footage, a photo/card collage, a results screen, a hero shot, and the end card.

**Rendered file:** [`renders/wai-brand-film.mp4`](renders/wai-brand-film.mp4)

```bash
npm run render:wai   # writes out/wai-brand-film.mp4
```

| Time | Shot | Caption |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0–2.4s | Footage: lacing trainers | health isn't |
| 2.4–4.2s | Footage: sunrise run | another app |
| 4.2–6.0s | Footage: glass of water | it's the small things |
| 6.0–8.4s | App: "Today" tracker, habits tick off | |
| 8.4–12.0s | Footage: stretch, breakfast | |
| 12.0–14.0s | Footage: clinic | tracked, |
| 14.0–19.4s | Collage on caramel: photos and result cards | …understood, improved |
| 19.4–21.6s | App: vitamin D result rising into optimal range | |
| 21.6–25.8s | Footage: golden-hour walk | one place / that actually gets it |
| 25.8–30.0s | End card: Wai logo on espresso | medical intelligence, made personal |

**Footage:** the real-life shots are placeholders until clips are added. See `public/wai/footage/README.md` for filenames and the shot list. The grade (warm highlights, espresso shadows, film grain, vignette) is applied automatically in `src/wai/Footage.tsx`.

Shot timings and captions are in `src/wai/timeline.ts`. The logo is `public/wai/wai-logo-cream.png`.

# Wai: "11 Seconds" (landscape)

A 32-second 16:9 film (1920×1080, 30fps) in an editorial collage style: grid backgrounds, halftone scraps, floating cutouts, kinetic scattered type, a gradient statement slide, a chat-bubble UI beat and a dark end card. No people.

**Rendered file:** [`renders/eleven-seconds.mp4`](renders/eleven-seconds.mp4) · `npm run render:eleven`

| Time | Beat |
|---|---|
| 0.0–6.3s | Stopwatch ticks to 11: "11 seconds." + stat, source J Gen Intern Med, 2018 |
| 6.3–13.3s | Stethoscope, clipboard; screen + keyboard drift between the speech bubbles: "It's not rudeness. It's the note." |
| 13.3–16.3s | Gradient slide: "What if no one had to?" |
| 16.3–24.8s | Waveform bubble; note / letter / coding cards draft themselves |
| 24.8–28.3s | Stopwatch returns, still: "Take all the time you need." |
| 28.3–32.0s | End card: Wai logo, "Care, uninterrupted.", wellnessa-i.com |

Everything lives in `src/eleven/ElevenSeconds.tsx` (beat timings at the top). The objects are SVG illustrations; the logo is `public/wai/wai-logo-white.webp`.
